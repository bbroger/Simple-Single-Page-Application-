# Simple-Single-Page-Application-
This is a sample version of a Single Page Application that loads the navigations asynchronously. I like this solutions because it can be quite useful for you to implement in your quick projects, or even projects where you need to do some tests in different separated html files. This is nice because you can separate html for each route in your view folder.
